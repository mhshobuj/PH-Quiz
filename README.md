# PH-Quiz
Certainly! It's a classic quiz game where each question carries a specific point value. After answering all the questions, if the player achieves the highest score, it will be displayed on the dashboard as their high score. Players also have the option to play the quiz again if they wish to do so.

Libraries and Technologies Used:

MVVM & LiveData: MVVM architecture, coupled with LiveData, separates business logic from UI components and ensures that data is observed and updated consistently across the app.

Coroutines: Coroutines facilitate asynchronous programming, enabling tasks to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread, leading to a more responsive user interface.

View Binding: View Binding simplifies the process of referencing UI elements, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving code readability.

Coil: Coil is utilized for image loading and caching. It optimizes image loading, reducing load times and enhancing the overall user experience.

Dagger Hilt: Dagger Hilt provides dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and create modular, maintainable code.
